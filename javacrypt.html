            JAVACRYPT - An easy way to encrypt & decrypt text offline (inspired from/by N.O.D.E. & linenoise/asemica). <br />
            <br />
            How does it work? <br />
            For the inner workings of the code, the program has a set of rules depending on what key is pressed. <br />
            The more characters that are pressed, the more complex the encryption will be. <br />
            Thing thing that makes this different from pgp or gpg, however, is that it allows the user to make the key. <br />
            If you think of it like entering a long password, it would be very hard to crack! <br />
            <br />
            To use this, you first enter in the text that you want to encrypt into the top box. <br />
            In the one below it, put in a string of characters that is memorable and shareable. <br />
            Then, you will see your encrypted message ready to go. <br />
            Now all you need to do is send the text and let the recipient know about the string you came up with. <br />
            It will be up to them, at that point, to decrypt the message by following these steps backwards. <br />
