# javacrypt
An easy way to encrypt & decrypt text offline.

How does it work?
-
For the inner workings of the code, the program has a set of rules depending on what key is pressed.

First, you enter in the text that you want to encrypt into the top box (the more characters, the more complex).
In the one below it, put in a string of characters that is memorable and shareable.
Then, you will see your encrypted message ready to go.
Now all you need to do is send the text and let the recipient know about the string you came up with.
It will be up to them, at that point, to decrypt the message by following these steps backwards.
